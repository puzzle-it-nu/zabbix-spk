Since Zabbix 6.2.8, ZBX-22588, only HTTP, HTTPS protocols are supported in web scenarios. This package includes FTP and RSTP protocols support


It consists of Zabbix server, Zabbix Proxy and Zabbix agent and uses the Synology supplied mysql/mariadb datbase server. 
Package is build to run only one Zabbix Server OR one Zabbix Proxy, but not Zabbix Server and proxy on the same time.

Please ask in case your package is not available.
